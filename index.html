    <h1>About Fibonacci sequence</h1>
    In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.
